OfficeSpace is a smart office application designed to streamline parking management, promote eco-friendly carpooling, and improve workplace communication for reporting and resolving issues. Developed to enhance efficiency and foster a collaborative office environment, OfficeSpace addresses the daily challenges employees face regarding parking availability and workplace issue management.

## Motivation

The project was inspired by common challenges observed in the office:
- Limited parking spots and lack of pre-determined allocations lead to daily competition and delays.
- Inefficient use of parking spaces, with some remaining vacant due to employee absences.
- Employees with similar commutes rarely coordinate on carpooling due to a lack of a platform.
- No centralized system for reporting maintenance or facility issues, leading to delays in resolutions.
  
OfficeSpace is sponsored by my company, which recognizes the need for a comprehensive, user-friendly solution to improve the daily workflow and operational efficiency in the office environment.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Parking Allocation
   - **Pre-Request Submission:** Employees can enter details like their location, expected arrival, and departure times before a daily 12 AM cutoff.
   - **Smart Allocation Algorithm:** Prioritizes parking spots based on factors such as proximity to the office, traffic conditions, and employee work schedules.
   - **Real-Time Notifications:** Employees receive notifications about their parking status, helping reduce uncertainty and save time.

### 2. Carpooling Coordination
   - **Eco-Friendly Ride-Sharing:** Employees with similar routes can connect and share rides, promoting eco-friendly practices and reducing parking demand.
   - **Convenient Matching System:** Employees are matched based on proximity and commute timing to facilitate easy carpooling arrangements.

### 3. Workplace Issue Reporting
   - **Complaint Submission System:** Allows employees to report issues like maintenance needs and infrastructure problems.
   - **Image Attachment:** Users can attach images and provide detailed descriptions for faster and more accurate resolutions.
   - **Tracking and Updates:** Track the status of submitted complaints for transparency and accountability.
